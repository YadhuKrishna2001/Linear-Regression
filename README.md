# Linear-Regression
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple Linear Regression model that predicts students' scores based on the number of hours they studied.
It’s a classic beginner machine learning problem used to understand how supervised learning works and how to evaluate a regression model.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains two columns:
Hours – Number of hours a student studied
Scores – Percentage of marks obtained

Learning Outcome
Understand Linear Regression basics
Learn data preprocessing and model evaluation
Build and visualize a predictive model using Scikit-learn
